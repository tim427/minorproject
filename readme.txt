GAMEPLAY				|
________________________|
The game is played from a first person perspective, putting you right in the darkness. The purpose of the game is to escape, which is done by finding the elevator that will take you to safety. To find this elevator,
the protagonist will have to navigate through the prison, having to find key cards or switches that will open specific doors. However, there are also several guards (both alien guards and drones) that patrol the area, taking action if they find the player.
The player will have to be both sneaky and agile to stay out of danger, and will find certain ways to aid in their goal. For example, there's an EMP device that can be found that disables all nearby drone guards.
