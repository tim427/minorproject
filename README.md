Minorproject Software Ontwerpen en Toepassen
============


Introduction
============
This document describes the assignment for the minorproject EWI3620TU. It is part of the minor
“Software Ontwerpen en Toepassen” and is held during the 2nd quarter of this study year.

Background
============
The “rise of the indies” is a very hot topic nowadays. Online shops, such as Steam or Google Play Store,
are filled with indie games, as great software packages, such as Unity, allow almost anyone to create a
game and export it to the most popular gaming platforms.
This also gave rise to many “game jams”, where individuals or groups of developers get to create a
game in a very short time. Often, themes are involved in order to inspire the creative minds of the game
developer. Many of the indie games that are popular right now, were firstly created during a game jam!
Developers simply experiment with game mechanics and find great potential and inspiration in their
designs. The best ones are often further developed, beyond the jam.

Goals
============
During this project, you will make a complete, technically challenging and fun game using Unity in
groups of 5 students. Thus, you will...
- ...gain experience in software development
- ...gain experience in developing software in teams
- ...gain experience in advanced programming
- ...gain experience in writing intelligent algorithms
- ...gain experience in gathering, storing and visualizing player data
In addition, you will also...
- ...gain experience in indie game development and game jamming
- ...gain experience with 3D game engines
- ...gain experience with the (indie) industry standard software
- ...gain experience in 3D modeling, texturing and shading
- ...gain experience in analyzing and testing your game
In short, you will experience game development and even become an indie game developer with
enough experience to create your own video game.
